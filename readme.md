## Intro

This project contains a series of scripts for resolving a full set of movies from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [IMDB](https://imdb.com/) in batches and storing them into a Postgres [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) database.

This process includes data normalization, cleaning, and filtering. All steps are idempotent, so you should be able to re-run them whenever you want to refresh your data.

## Movie Schema

Movies are transformed into the following format, which largely follows the TMDB movie details format converted to snakeCase with some additional data from IMDB like ratings and keywords.

## Prerequisites

- `node >= 16`
- `pnpm >= 7`
- [TMDB API v3 bearer token](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
- [Prisma Postgres database URL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgres)

Store your `TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN` and `DATABASE_URL` in a local `.env` file.

You'll need to download a recent [daily export of TMDB movie IDs](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/daily-file-exports) such as [10/30/2022](http://files.tmdb.org/p/exports/movie_ids_10_30_2022.json.gz) and store the uncompressed version into `data/tmdb_dump_movie_ids.json`. This gives us a full list of TMDB movie IDs to kick things off.

If you want movies to contain IMDB ratings, you'll also need to download an official [IMDB title ratings data dump](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). We're specifically interested in `title.ratings` such as [datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz) and store the uncompressed version into `data/title.ratings.tsv`. This file contains a large sample of IMDB movie IDs and their associated IMDB ratings + number of votes, which is nice because it is an official data source that drastically reduces the amount of scraping we need to do. Note that IMDB has [an official API](https://developer.imdb.com/), but it is extremely expensive to use (starting at $50k + usage-based billing).

## Steps

Once we have the data dumps downloaded into `data/` and our environment variables setup, we can start processing movies. Most of the processing steps break things up into batches (defaults to 32000 movies per batch) in order to allow for incremental processing and easier debugging.

**All scripts are idempotent**, so you can run these steps repeatedly and expect up-to-date results (ignoring occasional HTTP errors which are inevitable).

Before getting started, make sure you've run `pnpm install` to initialize the Node.js project.

### Populate TMDB Movies

Next, we'll run `npx tsx src/populate-tmdb-movie-dump.ts` which populates each of the TMDB movie IDs with its corresponding TMDB movie details and stores the results into a series of batched JSON files `out/tmdb-0.json`, `out/tmdb-1.json`, etc. _(takes ~1 hour)_

The result is ~655k movies in 24 batches of 32k.

### Process Movies

Next, we'll run `npx tsx src/process-movies.ts` which takes all of the previously resolved TMDB movies and transforms them to a normalized schema, adding in IMDB ratings from our partial IMDB data dump. This will output normalized JSON movies in batched JSON files `out/movies-0.json`, `out/movies-1.json`, etc. _(takes ~30 seconds)_

We also filters movies which are unlikely to be relevant for our use case:

- filters adult movies
- filters movies which are not released yet (~1.5%)
- filters movies which do not have a valid IMDB id (~40%)
- filters movies which do not have a valid YouTube trailer (~58%)
- filters music videos
- filters movies which are too short
- adds additional IMDB info from any previous `populate-tmdb-movies` cache (if `out/tmdb-movies.json` exists)

The result is ~78k movies.

### Populate IMDB Movies

The next **optional** step is to download additional IMDB info for each movie, using a [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)-based scraper called [movier](https://github.com/Zoha/movier). Note that we self-impose a strict rate-limit on the IMDB scraping, so this step will take a long time to run and requires a solid internet connection with minimal interruptions. _(takes 1-2 days)_

If you want to download additional IMDB metadata for all movies, including additional rating info, you'll need to run `npx tsx src/populate-imdb-movies.ts` which will read in our normalized movies from `out/movie-0.json`, `out/movie-1.json`, etc, process each movie individually with `movier` and store the results in JSON hashmap keyed by IMDB ID to `out/imdb-movies.json`

Once you are finished populating IMDB movies, you'll need to re-run `npx tsx src/process-movies.ts`, which will now take into account the extra IMDB metadata that was downloaded to our local cache.

### Upsert Movies into Prisma

The final **optional** step is to upsert all movies into your Prisma database. (_takes ~30 seconds)_

Make sure that you run have `DATABASE_URL` set to a Postgres instance in your `.env` file and then run `npx prisma db push` to sync the Prisma schema with your database (as well as generating the prisma client locally in `node_modules`).

Now you should be ready to run `npx tsx src/upsert-movies-to-db.ts` which will run through `out/movies-0.json`, `out/movies-1.json`, etc and upsert each movie into the Prisma database.

### Query Movies from Prisma

You should now have a Postgres database fully populated with movies, complete with the most important metadata from TMDB and IMDB. Huzzah!

You can run `npx tsx scripts/scratch.ts` to run an example Prisma query.

## Stats

- 750k "movies" in TMDB
- 73k movies after resolving and filtering

  - 44k english movies
  - 34k movies made in the U.S.
    - (80% of these are made exclusively in the U.S.)
  - 4.3k movies made in India
    - (99% of these are made exclusively in India)
  - 1.3k movies made in China
    - (40% of these are made exclusively in China)
  - 30k movies have at least 1k votes on IMDB
  - 17k movies have at least an IMDB rating of 7
  - 29k movies have at least an IMDB rating of 6.5
  - 40k movies have at least an IMDB rating of 6

(_all stats are approximate_)
